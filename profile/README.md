# Les champs de pistes: an unbounded distributed collaborative music

## Motivations

How could an unlimited number of people collaborate on one piece of music?

How could this be accessible to as many people as possible? To people with little
money or technical knowledge or bandwidth?

How could this happen with as little technology as possible?


## The idea

A _champ de pistes_ is a conceptual tape recorder with a potentially unbounded
number of tracks called _pistes_, numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.

Pistes contain audio _segments_, recordings of audio.

Each segment has a _length_ and a _start time_ within its piste. No two segments in a piste can overlap.

A mix is a

I want to re-emphasize that at its base, "les champs des pistes" is not a
technological thing, though simple technology will exist to help composers and
curators.  A small group of people could agree to a champ de pistes and organize
it in their heads or on paper using LPs, cassettes, or (depending on your
definition of what a "recording" is), sheet music and stopwatches.




## The details

Take all these definitions as conceptual, not technical, though technical
interpretations will appear.

A "recording" is some mechanical, electrical, electronic, digital or other thing that accurately reproduces a musical composition or performance.

"recording" does not mandate some sort of hardware or software or anything


A simple "tape" is a recording with a length and a start point in time.

A single "tape" is zero or more "recordings", each one attached to a point in time.
